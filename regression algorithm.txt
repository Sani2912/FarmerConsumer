Linear Regression is algorithm which is used to predict continous values based on previous data.This is Supervised Machine learning algorithm.
It finds linear relationship between variables.Based on it tries to predict new values.
Algorithm:
1.Take all the Features(Independent Values).
2.Preprocess the Data.
3.Divide data into train and test data.
4.Build a linear regression Model.
5.Train the model with train data.
6.Evaluate model with test data.
7.Parameter Tuning(Generally done by changing number of training steps,Learning rate,intialization values and distribution).
8.Predict the values.

Polynomial Regression is also used to predict continous values based on data. This is also supervised algorithm.
But here it finds polynomial type of relationship between variables instead of linear relationship.Based on the trained model it tries to predict new values.
Algorithm:
1.Take all the Features(Independent Values).
2.Preprocess the Data.
3.Divide data into train and test data.
4.Build a polynomial regression Model.
5.Train the model with train data.
6.Evaluate model with test data.
7.Parameter Tuning(Generally done by changing number of training steps,Learning rate,intialization values and distribution).
8.Predict the values.
